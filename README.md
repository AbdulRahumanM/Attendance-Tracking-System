# Attendance-Tracking-System

This project was done when I joined SAP Labs to showcase my technical skillsets. 
The Web app has an attendance tracking facility to track the employee attendance. The developed system enables the system admin to monitor the trend and behavioural changes of employees work hours. It is developed to enable multiple users to login with session management and also it supports multiple languages.
